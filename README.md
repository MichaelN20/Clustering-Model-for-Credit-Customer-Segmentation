# Clustering-Model-for-Credit-Customer-Segmentation

### **Dataset Information:**
This dataset contains information about customers' use of credit cards.

### **Objective:**
The project is designed to **create a classification of customer credit grouping for a bank, with data obtained using BigQuery. The collected data is then understood and processed for a Clustering model. Clustering is performed using Scikit-Learn.**

### **Problems:**
Develop a clustering model to **conduct Customer Segmentation from a bank's credit card data** below. This data includes **information on credit card usage for the last 6 months.**

### **Tools:**
- **Data Manipulation:** Python, Pandas, Numpy
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Express
- **Feature Engineering:** Feature-Engine (Winsorizer)
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (StandardScaler, PCA, KMeans, silhouette_score, silhouette_samples), Yellowbrick (SilhouetteVisualizer)
- **Model Evaluation:** Classification Report, Confusion Matrix, ConfusionMatrixDisplay, F1 Score, Accuracy Score, Precision Score, Recall Score
- **Model Persistence:** pickle, json
